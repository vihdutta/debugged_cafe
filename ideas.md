### About

Welcome to Debugged Cafe, where our coffee is sure to give you a buzz! 

We are an environmently conscious local coffee shop based in Richmond, VA. 5 years ago, a group of tired programmers working on debugging their code had a "bee-utiful" idea to create a coffee shop for programmers. Combining their passion for environment sustaibability and making others happy, they opened Debugged Cafe!

When most people think of bugs, they neglect the nutritional value of the little critters. Bugs are a highly sustainable source of protein that require much less maintainance and have a much smaller impact on the environment than traditional livestock. At Debugged Cafe, we combine the exotic yet familar flavors of bugs with coffee to create a unique experience while also raising public awareness about the potential of bugs. One of our sources of inspiration (aside from the bug puns!) was Sourdough, a novel by Robin Sloan. In one scene, the main character encounters an innovative baker who uses cricket flour. Our coffees have the same principle: to make great nutritious and sustainable food!
